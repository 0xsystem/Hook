This code illustrates how to hook a function, notably the user32.dll library's MessageBoxA function. Hooking a function entails stopping a function's execution and substituting the result with the hook function. The hook function that takes the place of the original MessageBoxA function in this code is the HookedMessageBoxA function. 
The code first loads the user32.dll library before using the GetProcAddress function to get a pointer to the original MessageBoxA function. The original function is then replaced with the hook function using memcpy to copy the hook function to the original function's location and VirtualProtect to alter the original function's memory protection to enable writing.  
The original function is then invoked by the code, followed by the hook function, to show how the original function has been replaced. The user32.dll library is unloaded using the FreeLibrary function, and then the program ends.
